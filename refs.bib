abstract = {Recent years have witnessed many breakthroughs in research on graphene (the first two-dimensional atomic crystal) as well as a significant advance in the mass production of this material. This one-atom-thick fabric of carbon uniquely combines extreme mechanical strength, exceptionally high electronic and thermal conductivities, impermeability to gases, as well as many other supreme properties, all of which make it highly attractive for numerous applications. Here we review recent progress in graphene research and in the development of production methods, and critically analyse the feasibility of various graphene applications.Novoselov, K. S., Fal’ko, V.

abstract = {Graphene edges are of particular interest, since their chirality determines the electronic properties. Here we present a detailed Raman investigation of graphene flakes with well defined edges oriented at different crystallographic directions. The position, width and intensity of G and D peaks at the edges are studied as a function of the incident light polarization. The D-band is strongest for light polarized parallel to the edge and minimum for perpendicular orientation. Raman mapping shows that the D peak is localized in proximity of the edge. The D to G ratio does not always show a significant dependence on edge orientation. Thus, even though edges can appear macroscopically smooth and oriented at well defined angles, they are not necessarily microscopically ordered.},

abstract = {Graphene sheets were produced through chemical exfoliation of natural graphite flake and hydrazine conversion. Subsequently, graphene sheets were assembled into a thin film, and microscale liquid droplets were placed onto the film surface for measurement of wettability and contact angle. It is found that a graphene oxide sheet is hydrophilic and a graphene sheet is hydrophobic. Isolated graphene layers seem more difficult to wet in comparison to graphite, and low adhesion work was found in the graphene-liquid interface. Approximation of solid-liquid interfacial energy with the equation of state theory was applied to determine the graphene surface energy. The results indicate that surface energy of graphene and graphene oxide is 46.7 and 62.1 mJ/m2, respectively, while natural graphite flake shows a surface free energy of 54.8 mJ/m2 at room temperature. These results will provide valuable guidance for the design and manufacturing of graphene-based biomaterials, medical instruments, structural composites, electronics, and renewable energy devices.},

@article{Lotya2009a,
abstract = {We have demonstrated a method to disperse and exfoliate graphite to give graphene suspended in water-surfactant solutions. Optical characterization of these suspensions allowed the partial optimization of the dispersion process. Transmission electron microscopy showed the dispersed phase to consist of small graphitic flakes. More than 40\% of these flakes had <5 layers with approximately 3\% of flakes consisting of monolayers. Atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy shows the monolayers to be generally free of defects. The dispersed graphitic flakes are stabilized against reaggregation by Coulomb repulsion due to the adsorbed surfactant. We use DLVO and Hamaker theory to describe this stabilization. However, the larger flakes tend to sediment out over approximately 6 weeks, leaving only small flakes dispersed. It is possible to form thin films by vacuum filtration of these dispersions. Raman and IR spectroscopic analysis of these films suggests the flakes to be largely free of defects and oxides, although X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows evidence of a small oxide population. Individual graphene flakes can be deposited onto mica by spray coating, allowing statistical analysis of flake size and thickness. Vacuum filtered films are reasonably conductive and are semitransparent. Further improvements may result in the development of cheap transparent conductors.},

A paper by Wu et al. in this issue discusses the use of solution-processed graphene as the TCE in organic light-emitting devices. Advantages such as large-scale fabrication at relatively less expense, compatibility with flexible substrates, and improving performance have significantly contributed to their case as potential candidates for TCEs. Demonstrations of various display and photovoltaic devices using TCEs made of these materials, with performances rivaling those employing ITO, have provided the research community with encouragement to explore new materials and to address the associated scientific and technological challenges.},

abstract = {One of the problems with solvent exfoliation of graphene is that the best solvents tend to have high boiling points and so are difficult to remove and can present problems for flake deposition and composite formation. Here, we demonstrate the exfoliation of graphene at relatively high concentration in low boiling point solvents such as chloroform and isopropanol. It is possible to achieve concentrations of up to 0.5 mg/mL, just under half that which can be achieved with high boiling point solvents such as N-methyl-pyrrolidone. These dispersions consist of graphene flakes of 1 $\mu$m length and with a thickness of less than 10 layers (5 layers for isopropanol). For both solvents, >75\% of the graphene remains dispersed indefinitely. Raman spectroscopy shows the flakes to be relatively defect-free. A significant advantage of low boiling point solvents is that they allow individual flakes to be spray cast onto substrates. Deposited densities of >10 flakes with length >1 $\mu$m per 10 $\mu$m 10 $\mu$m square have been controllably achieved.

@article{Geim2007,
abstract = {Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

abstract = {The outstanding electrical, mechanical and chemical properties of graphene make it attractive for applications in flexible electronics. However, efforts to make transparent conducting films from graphene have been hampered by the lack of efficient methods for the synthesis, transfer and doping of graphene at the scale and quality required for applications. Here, we report the roll-to-roll production and wet-chemical doping of predominantly monolayer 30-inch graphene films grown by chemical vapour deposition onto flexible copper substrates. The films have sheet resistances as low as approximately 125 ohms square(-1) with 97.4\% optical transmittance, and exhibit the half-integer quantum Hall effect, indicating their high quality. We further use layer-by-layer stacking to fabricate a doped four-layer film and measure its sheet resistance at values as low as approximately 30 ohms square(-1) at approximately 90\% transparency, which is superior to commercial transparent electrodes such as indium tin oxides. Graphene electrodes were incorporated into a fully functional touch-screen panel device capable of withstanding high strain.},

@article{Hernandez2008,
abstract = {Fully exploiting the properties of graphene will require a method for the mass production of this remarkable material. Two main routes are possible: large-scale growth or large-scale exfoliation. Here, we demonstrate graphene dispersions with concentrations up to approximately 0.01 mg ml(-1), produced by dispersion and exfoliation of graphite in organic solvents such as N-methyl-pyrrolidone. This is possible because the energy required to exfoliate graphene is balanced by the solvent-graphene interaction for solvents whose surface energies match that of graphene. We confirm the presence of individual graphene sheets by Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. Our method results in a monolayer yield of approximately 1 wt\%, which could potentially be improved to 7-12 wt\% with further processing. The absence of defects or oxides is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron, infrared and Raman spectroscopies. We are able to produce semi-transparent conducting films and conducting composites. Solution processing of graphene opens up a range of potential large-area applications, from device and sensor fabrication to liquid-phase chemistry.},
